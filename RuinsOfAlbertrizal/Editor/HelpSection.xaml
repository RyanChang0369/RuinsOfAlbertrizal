                <Paragraph>
                    One save file (map.xml) is used to track player progress in the game. The other
                    (map-static.xml) is used for editing the map. Whenever a change is made in the Map
                    Editor, the change is reflected in map-static.xml when the edited map is saved.
                    When reseting/exporting the map, map.xml is overwritten by map-static.xml.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph Style="{StaticResource h2P}">Error: Save file cannot be read!</Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    This error can be caused by the manual editing of the save files or by corruption of
                    the save files. If this error is caused after editing map.xml, reseting/exporting the
                    map should fix the error. Otherwise, use the save file for the campaign as a template
                    for rebuilding your save file.

                    To create a map, click on the Create New Custom Map button located on the homepage.
                    After you select a location to create the map, you will be redirected to the Map Creator
                    where you can create your map. Remember to save the map before closing the editor.

                <Paragraph>
                    To play a custom map, you must first reset/export your map by clicking on the
                    Reset/Export button and selecting the map save file if necessary. This will reset
                    the map to ensure any progress you make from testing the map does not make it
                    into the final product.

                <Paragraph>
                    If you do want to play-test your map, edit the map.xml file to give your character

                <Paragraph>
                    The battle index is a measure of how powerful a character is. It is calculated by adding
                    all of the character's armored stats (stats gained from armor plus basic stats).

                    When a enemy is slain, points get added to a counter in the current level.
                    When the amount of points is greater than or equal to the user-defined max points, the
                    boss fight for that level will start

                <Paragraph>
                    The amount of points gained from killing an enemy is equal to 1/10th the enemy's battle

                    Mana determies what attacks a character can use. When using an attack that uses mana,
                    the attack's mana is subtracted from the player's mana pool.

                    A character may choose to recover their mana. When they do, 30% of their max mana is

                    Timers are set to the speed of the character with the most speed. When the timer
                    reaches a speed value of a character, the character is able to make a move.

                <Paragraph>
                    A turn is a unit of time where a character can perform one attack, movement, consumption
                    of an item, or mana replenishment.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    A round is made up of two turns. After a character's round is up, control is passed on to
                    the next character.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    The next character is determined by looking at their speed. A timer is first set up as 10 plus
                    the speed of the fastest character. When the timer reaches the speed of a character, that character
                    is chosen. In the case that two characters have the same speed, priority is first given to the player,
                    then the boss, then the enemy. In the case that two characters of the same type have the same speed,
                    the order is chosen randomly.
