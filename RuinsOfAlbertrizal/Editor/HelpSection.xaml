                <Paragraph>
                    The battle index is a measure of how powerful a character is. It is calculated by adding
                    all of the character's armored stats (stats gained from armor plus basic stats).

                <Paragraph>
                    When a enemy is slain, points get added to a counter in the current level.
                    When the amount of points is greater than or equal to the user-defined max points, the
                    boss fight for that level will start
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    The amount of points gained from killing an enemy is equal to 1/10th the enemy's battle
                    index.

                <Paragraph>
                    Mana determies what attacks a character can use. When using an attack that uses mana,
                    the attack's mana is subtracted from the player's mana pool.

                <Paragraph>
                    A character may choose to recover their mana. When they do, 30% of their max mana is
                    restored and their turn is ended.

                <Paragraph>
                    Speed determines how fast a character can attack.
                    Timers are set to the speed of the character with the most speed. When the timer
                    reaches a speed value of a character, the character is able to make a move.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    In case of a tie, the order of attack is chosen randomly.

                <Paragraph Style="{StaticResource h1P}">Turns and Rounds</Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    A turn is a unit of time where a character can perform one attack, movement, consumption
                    of an item, or mana replenishment.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    A round is made up of two turns. After a character's round is up, control is passed on to
                    the next character.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    The next character is determined by looking at their speed. A timer is first set up as 10 plus
                    the speed of the fastest character. When the timer reaches the speed of a character, that character
                    is chosen. In the case that two characters have the same speed, priority is first given to the player,
                    then the boss, then the enemy. In the case that two characters of the same type have the same speed,
                    the order is chosen randomly.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>The timer does not count down when a character is doing their move.</Paragraph>
